  - Once upon a time...
  - The goat had to survive until sunrise
  - It's charge could never hurt the wolf
  - But it could at least protect him
  - The wolf was ferocious
  - Though he had yet to display his full potential
  - Would the goat ever see the sunrise again ?
  - Half the night had passed
  - And neither of them faltered
  - The wolf had finally acknowledged his opponent
  - Yet the goat remained silent
  - The night was coming to a close...
